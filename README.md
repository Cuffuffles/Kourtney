# Kourtney

download and run should work

https://github.com/Cuffuffles/Kourtney/releases/tag/v1-release-beta-ultra-bonanza-alpha-cookie

for legal reasons this is not a client but simply a web browser i created with https://kour.io as the homepage

currently the url bar and tabs have not been implemented and so the browser can only play kour :)

fixes aim freeze bug found in recent/current chromium versions

hover over text in top right to close or just hit alt+f4 idc

f11 for fullscreen toggle

f12 for dev tools
